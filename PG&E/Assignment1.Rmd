Load data for 2017-2020 and then 2021:

```

Manipulate to convert the units
```{r}
pge_20_elec_convert <-
     mutate(pge_20_elec, TOTALKBTU = TOTALKWH * 3412.14)

#The if function thing I did above was not working for gas for some reason, I think it's an issue with Types
pge_20_gas_convert <-
  mutate(pge_20_gas, TOTALKBTU = TOTALTHM * 99.9761)

```


Filtering the columns in electricity and gas
Choosing which columns to keep
Then combining them
```{r}
pge_elec_filter <- filter(pge_20_elec_convert, CUSTOMERCLASS %in% c("Elec- Residential","Elec- Commercial"))

pge_gas_filter <- filter(pge_20_gas_convert, CUSTOMERCLASS %in% c("Gas- Residential", "Elec- Commercial"))

pge_elec_select <-
  select(
    pge_elec_filter,
    -c(YEAR, COMBINED, AVERAGEKWH, TOTALKWH)
  )

pge_gas_select <-
  select(
    pge_gas_filter,
    -c(YEAR, COMBINED, AVERAGETHM, TOTALTHM)
  )

pge_20_elec_gas <- rbind(pge_elec_select,pge_gas_select)
saveRDS(pge_20_elec_gas, "pge_20_elec_gas.rds")
```

Building the plot
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
str(pge_20_elec_gas)


```







## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
